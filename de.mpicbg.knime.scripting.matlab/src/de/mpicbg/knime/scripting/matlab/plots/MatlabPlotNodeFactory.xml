    <name>Matlab Plot</name>

    <shortDescription>
        Creates plot with Matlab within Knime.
    </shortDescription>

    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
            <p>
                This node creates plots using an Matlab server. The script for Matlab can be selected from a plot
                template repository.
                RGG (<a href="http://rgg.r-forge.r-project.org/index.html">R GUI Generator</a>)
                is used to configure the Matlab code using a graphical user interface in a way that the user does not
                need to know scripting in Matlab.
                URL of the template file can be set in Knime->Preferences->Knime->Matlab Scripting.
                The plot window can be rescaled and replotted by double-clicking onto the plot.
                <br/>
                The input data table is sent to Matlab as a matlab-dataset named "kIn". The plot from Matlab is sent
                back to Knime as the output.
            </p>
            <p>
                Script Editor:
                <br/>
                Copy, cut or paste and Matlab code to the editor and/or select the columns from your data table. If a
                template is loaded used the GUI to adapt the script to the input data.
            </p>
            <p>
                Templates:
                Select a plot template from the template repository (double-click or "Use this template") to use that
                script and see the GUI.
                The description shows you an example plot than can be done using this template.
                Then configure the GUI according to your input data.
            </p>
            <p>
                Output Options:
                Specify the image dimensions of the plot and the type and location where to save that image.
            </p>
            <p>
                IMPORTANT :
                <br/>
                This node is using Matlab as backend, make sure that Matlab server is running somewhere, and Knime is
                accordingly
                configured (Knime->Preferences->Knime->Matlab Scripting).
